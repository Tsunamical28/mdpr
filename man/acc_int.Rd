\description{
Bonds typically trade based on a "clean price," which does not include
accrued interest. To calculate yields etc. "dirty price" must first be
calculated by including accrued interest. This function assumes that the
dates passed in confrom to the convention that \code{settle} is between
\code{accrual_start} and \code{next_coupon}.
